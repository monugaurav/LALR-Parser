<img src="https://github.com/utilForever/LALR-Parser/blob/master/Logo.png" align="center" />

LALR-Parser is a bottom-up parser generator that can deal with some context-sensitive languages - particularly programming languages. The algorithm used is an extension of the venerable LALR algorithm, alongside a DFA based lexer.
